At this level, you will find the system's details focusing on the architecture and used technologies. 
You can see your containers' description (it is not Docker) and how they communicate/interact.

The idea is to show how the system is in a bigger way and how a container can be a web application, a database, a system file, etc. 


Ritchie CLI has the following modules (each module is a container):

- **RitchieCLI:** Command line interface, execution engine, and formula sharing. 

- **FÃ³rmulas:** Arbitrary code provided by the user using Ritchie CLI or the community, generally for automation purposes.
