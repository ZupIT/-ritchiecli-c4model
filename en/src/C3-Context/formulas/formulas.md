## **Formulas**
A formula is an independent program and it is adapted to execute and/or share via Ritchie CLI. 

- You can write formulas in any programming language. 
- Ritchie CLI has out-of-box support for a finite list of languages. However,  it can be adapted for you to work with new options in an easier way via file edition templates.
