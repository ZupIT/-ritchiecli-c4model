## **Overview**

Software architecture defines the parts of the software and it is also a technological strategy of a product/project.  However, it needs to be always updated to avoid failures.
 
### **Architecture documentation**
When you document the architecture of a project, it is a process that requires time, tools knowledge, and diagramming techniques. The biggest challenge is to avoid two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** Complex documentation that can be confusing, obsolete and loses its purpose.

- **Scenario 2:** Documentation with flaws and lack of information. 

In both cases, the final result can make the user confused. 

The project's architecture documentation is important for the users to have a better experience. So, when you document you should answer some questions, for example:  
- How does my system integrate with other systems?  
- How can I scale my application?
- How to ensure security between my applications?

Ritchie CLI team thought about this and we created a view of our architecture, the C4 model. 

## **What is C4 Model?**
The C4 Model was created by Simon Brow,  based on 4+1 and UML. The model helps to solve architectural documentation problems. 
It is divided into four types of diagrams and there are different levels of detail and a target audience.
The goal is to bring more clarity to the project and you can find more details and information at every level.

## **What is Ritchie CLI?**

Ritchie CLI is an open source command line interface, arbitrary code sharing, and execution engine. The tool allows the user to create, execute and share automation or any type of programming code. It is simple and quick.
